# UMass Lowell Cloud Computing Club: Fall 2023

Welcome to the UMass Lowell Cloud Computing Club! Our mission is to explore cloud computing and its applications using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and related technologies. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, join us as we learn together, build projects, and connect with industry professionals.

## Announcements :loudspeaker:
- :tada: We are excited to announce that our College Degree Program Scheduler project has been officially named **UniPath.io**! Check out the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing/UniPath.io).

## [Project: UniPath.io](https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing/UniPath.io)

This semester, we are diving deep into a comprehensive cloud computing project named **UniPath.io**. We aim to develop a full-stack web application that allows users to create, plan, and share their class schedules for their entire degree program. This project will serve as a hands-on learning experience, covering various cloud computing and web development topics.

- **Learning Material:** This repository will serve as a centralized location to organize and publish the learning materials we use each week. It will include presentations, demos, tutorials, and other resources to aid our learning journey.

- **Project Repository:** The actual development of UniPath.io will take place in a separate repository. Our goal is to encourage members to actively contribute and commit to [that repository](https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing/UniPath.io). By doing so, members can demonstrate their skills, knowledge, and contributions to future employers. We believe that hands-on experience, reflected through genuine GitHub activity, is invaluable for showcasing one's capabilities.

Link to the project repository: https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing/UniPath.io

By the end of the semester, our aim is to have a fully functional web app deployed on AWS, showcasing the skills and knowledge we've gained.

## Meeting Schedule

**Meeting Time**: Every meeting will be from 6:30pm-9:30pm. 

- **Presentation Section (6:30pm-8:00pm)**: This portion is reserved for presentations, demos, and sometimes special guest speakers. It is more structured and follows the weekly topics closely.
  
- **Hands-On Section (8:00pm-9:30pm)**: This time is allocated for working on the semester project. It is more interactive, free-flowing, and unplanned, allowing for hands-on experience and collaboration.
